# 🔥 Hellcode Patterns: Welcome to the Hell of DSA Studying 👹🔥

_"Feel free to suffer... I mean, study."_

This repository contains structured **Anki-ready** cards for studying **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Each card contains:
- **Topic**
- **Description**
- **Iterative Approach**
- **Recursive Approach**
- **Difficulty Tags** (for filtering in Anki)

---

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### ✅ 1. Add a New Card
1. Navigate to the correct folder: `fundamentals/`, `common_problems/`, or `miscellaneous/`.
2. **Create a new directory** inside it with your card's topic.
3. **Add the following files** inside:
 * topic.txt
 * description.txt
 * iterative_steps.html
 * iterative_code.py
 * recursive_steps.html
 * recursive_code.py
 * tags.txt
4. Fill in your content! **If recursion does not apply, leave `recursive_steps.html` and `recursive_code.py` empty.**
5. Create unit tests for your Algorithm or add your reference in your PR

### 🔥 2. Fix or Improve Existing Cards
- Improve **explanations** or **fix bugs** in code.
- Add missing **recursive versions** where applicable.
- Improve **tags.txt** for better **Anki filtering**.

## 📦 Importing to Anki
Once your deck is complete:
1. **Convert to CSV** using a script (coming soon).
2. **Import CSV into Anki**.
3. **Filter by difficulty using tags** (e.g., `tag:easy`).
4. **Start studying** and embrace the suffering. 😈🔥

## 🤝 Contributing Guide
- **PRs are welcome!** Just make sure your card is well-structured.
- Open an **issue** if you want to suggest improvements.
- Check the **tags.txt** file to ensure consistency.
